## Synopsis

This plug-in for PaidMemberships Pro adds a flag for each discount code that allows you to suppress membership expiry e-mails. If someone signs up with this code, they will expire silently.

## Motivation

This plug-in was developed for a client who had large institutions buy n memberships (say, 100) to give out to their employees. She set up a discount code for them to give out to people, and then employees could sign up with it. But when their membership was about to expire, instead of the institution getting one e-mail, each individual member got one.

That was annoying, and not the best behavior. So this plug-in enables her to check the box once for the discount code, and then nobody that signed up with that code will get the e-mails.

## Installation

It requires PaidMemberships Pro to already be installed in your WordPress installation. From there, you can just install it as you would any other plug-in. There are no settings or options to configure - it's kind of a one-trick pony.
